      <h2 class="boxp">The Creator of This Website</h2>
      <p>Hello world, my name is Jeanalla Samuel, I am 16 years old, I recently graduated from secondary school and I am the creator of this website. I am from St. Lucia, a beautiful Caribbean island with alot of culture and fun. However, as a result of Covid-19 I realize that our culture and liveliness is becoming less and less by the days and also is the funds which was provided by the various cultural events. So, this is why I decided to create this website and create this solution to try to sustain the culture I love so much and help raise funds for the community. Learn more about my project.</p>
